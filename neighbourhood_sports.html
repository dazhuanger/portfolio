        <h3 class="div-title">Research and Analysis</h3>
        <h4 class="div-subtitle">Problem</h4>
        <p>
          The current platform of community centres fails to provide easy and simple ways to find sport partners
          locally. It features a cluttered and counterintuitive design, which is causing poor turnout to local parks and
          arenas.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- User assumptions -->
      <div class="text-box">
        <h4 class="div-subtitle">User Assumptions</h4>
        <p>
          Since we built everything from scratch in this project, there wasn't much stuff that we can use as a
          reference. So we decided to make some assumptions before starting the research, just to set up a preliminary
          structure for this project. We can later validate our assumptions based on our research findings and adjust
          accordingly, if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>-- Who could be the target users?</p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Young professionals.</span> Why? Because students often have dedicated facilities at
          school and a group of classmates to play sports with.
        </p>
        <p>-- What do they do?</p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">Play sports after work or during the weekends.</span> Why? Because they have a day
          job, the only time they can play would be after work or on weekends.
        </p>
        <p>-- What problems do they have currently?</p>
        <p>
          <span class="highlight">
            Have trouble finding local players to play with at the neighbourhood parks or courts.</span
          >
          Why? Because we often see that the courts and fields in community centres are empty. So that could be the
          reason.

          We then conducted another round of evaluation on the mid-fi wireframes with several users and gathered their

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The flow and structure are too linear. It lacks of a way to navigate horizontally between different pages at
            the same level.
          </li>

        <h4 class="div-subtitle">High-fi Prototype</h4>
        <p>
          This course project was finished in December 2018. The final deliverable was the mid-fi wireframes above. We
          did get some feedback on the mid-fi prototype from guest judges during our final presentation. However, we
          didn't have the opportunity to implement their suggestions.

        <p>
          Until recently, during this pandemic, I decided to work individually to revive this project by making a
          high-fidelity version for the iPhone X.
        </p>

        <p>
          I made quite a lot of changes in the high-fi prototype based on the feedback we got. First and foremost, I
          improved the UI elements, making them more mobile-friendly. In addition, I compressed several separate pages
          into one single page, which makes the MVP more efficient and less redundant.
