        <h3 class="div-title">Discovery</h3>
        <h4 class="div-subtitle">Who is the user?</h4>
        <p>
          Gateway is a platform for the bank's high-net-worth clients. Most Gateway users are around
          <span>55-65</span> years old, with <span>1 - 2 million</span> dollars managed by the bank's investment
          advisors. They use Gateway at least <span>twice a week</span> and visit more frequently during tax season.
          They are <span>market informed</span> and have an intermediate to expert level of knowledge. They typically
          focus on <span>long-term trends</span> instead of daily movements.
        </p>
        <h4 class="div-subtitle">What is the problem?</h4>
        <p>
          In a nutshell, Gateway is an outdated platform that needs an overhaul. Stakeholders have been asking for a
          change for a long time, and they all have different expectations of it. As a product designer, my role is to
          address these needs smartly and find the best way to balance them.
        </p>
        <h4 class="div-subtitle">Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          Clients are asking for a responsive version of Gateway, which is not available on the current platform. Data
          from analytics shows that
          <span>80%</span> of users are visiting either from a phone or a tablet. Also, they are expecting to see more
          translated information other than hard-to-digest raw data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Investment advisors want to see what their clients are seeing.
          <span>100%</span> of advisors we interviewed have mentioned the discrepancy between a client view and a staff
          view of Gateway has created troubles when communicating with clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the business goals, the bank's executives want to reduce costs and promote new services, while
          maintaining high client and employee satisfaction.
        </p>
        <h4 class="div-subtitle">Big ideas</h4>
        <p>
          The Venn diagram below depicts the expectations of different stakeholders and the opportunities we discovered
          through user research.

        <img class="gw-img" src="images/gateway/venn_diagram.png" alt="venn diagram" />
        <h4 class="div-subtitle">How might we?</h4>
        <p>
          How might we improve the experience of Gateway to let clients see how their investments are doing whenever
          they want, wherever they are, and allow business executives to achieve their goals?

              "Spyglass" mode connects the bank's internal system and client view. Once implemented, it will have a high
              impact and would facilitate the communication between investment advisors and clients. But due to
              technical constraints, the feasibility is relatively low.

              Performance reporting has high feasibility, but the impact is on an intermediate level since the current
              version is not hindering the user experience. So this feature is categorized as "nice to have".

        <p>
          The bank has a very <span>comprehensive design system</span>. Therefore, I didn't have to go through the paper
          sketches and mid-fi wireframes. Every design iteration was created directly in Sketch using the existing
          components.
        </p>
        <!-- eDocuments  -->
        <h4 class="div-subtitle">Feature 1: eDocuments</h4>
        <p>eDocuments service is the most frequently used feature on Gateway. The major pain-points users have are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="text">Hard to find the documents they want to see</li>
          <p>
            The information architecture needs a redesign. On the legacy system, the eDocuments settings are under the
            "My Account" tab, which is confusing for the users.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <img class="gw-desktop-static" src="images/gateway/bad_ia.png" alt="bad ia image" />

        <ul>
          <li class="text">Cumbersome user flow for eDocuments preferences settings</li>
          <p>
            The legacy system only supports account-level settings. The user flow of adjusting the preferences is
            cumbersome and tedious. If a user has multiple accounts, they will have to go through each of their
            accounts.
          </p>
        </ul>
        <img class="gw-desktop-static" src="images/gateway/cumbersome_ui.png" alt="cumbersome ui image" />
      </div>

      <div class="text-box">
        <h5>First Iteration</h5>
        <p>
          For the first iteration of the new eDocument preference page, I grouped the accounts by categories and offered
          a global level setting. Users will no longer need to go through each of their accounts to change the settings.
        </p>

        <h5>User testing feedback</h5>
        <p>
          I worked with our researcher to gather a round of feedback from other stakeholders, and also conducted an
          unmoderated user testing on usertesting.com
        </p>
        <img class="gw-desktop-static" src="images/gateway/legacy_feedback.png" alt="legacy feedback image" />

      <div class="text-box">
        <h5>Second iteration</h5>
        <ul>
          <li class="text">New "Go Paperless" button</li>
          <p>
            As the global level card confuses the user, I replaced it with a button that has the same function as the
            card. Users will be able to subscribe to eDocuments and alerts with <span>just one click</span>. And the
            button is a <span>one-time shot</span>. Once clicked, it will be disabled so that the user cannot
            unsubscribe so easily (which fulfills the business requirement). If they want to customize the settings for
            an individual account or a category of account, they can uncheck the corresponding checkbox.
          </p>
          <img class="gw-desktop-static" src="images/gateway/main_btn_highlight.png" alt="main button image" />
          <li class="text">Prompt for the user</li>
          <p>
            To address the issue of users forgetting to save the change, I added a prompt that shows up when there is an
            unsaved change. This is a <span>trade-off after consulting our tech lead.</span> Since the bank's back-end
            system cannot support frequent visits, the ideal way of dynamically saving changes when users check or
            uncheck a checkbox is not feasible.
          </p>
          <img class="gw-desktop-static" src="images/gateway/main_btn_disable_highlight.png" alt="main button image" />
          <li class="text">Better Information Architecture</li>
          <p>
            Lastly, the second iteration also improved the information architecture of the web app. Now users have a
            dedicated tab on the top nav bar to access their eDocuments.
          </p>
